# Mid-Course Milestone- Wildfires in the Western US

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis for mid-course project. I utilized a dataset from an established USGS project which can be found here:
https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/visualizations/fire-hydro/index.html#/

https://github.com/DOI-USGS/fire-hydro/tree/main/public/data


## Authors

- Molly Lott [@mollichite](https://www.github.com/mollichite)
- ChatGPT (specifically for the animation plot)


## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages: 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open "mid_mile_notebook.ipynb" in Jupyter

## Example Output
The analysis shows acerage burned from 1984-2020 in Montana, Wyoming, Utah, California, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico during various events and compares them overtime as well as by State.


## Lessons Learned


In terms of cleaning, I could have:
Capitalized the names of the actual fires and look for errors/validate the names(some seem quite odd).
Also there were some columns that I never figured out exactly what they meant like all the "scaled" headers.

I tried a heat map that I didn't really like.  Its in there but I didn't clean it up much since it was kind of boring.  I shifted to learning about the animated plot instead.

If I had more time:
Id like to bring in some water data to know if these states were in drought when the fires occurre.d
Additionally, weather data would also be interesting here.
Try and API for one of the above ideas
